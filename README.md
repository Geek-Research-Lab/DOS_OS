DOS_OS
======

To be honest, I am not so good in DOS... I have just started coding from referring existing codes and I am trying to build an existing project from it.

Practical self-learning and self-coding...

Contributions are highly welcome here :) And anybody can use it... It is 100% free and opensource.. :) Hope you make best use of it more than i did!


After completion of existing one, then i will be taking next step in updating it... Let's see where it takes! =P
